## Insight from real-estate data

In this example, we analyze clusters based on real-estate sale prices across different time periods to gain insights into market trends. In the figure below, youâ€™ll notice that the left map (showing average sales from 2015-17) highlights the upper east side as one (blue) cluster within the orange circle. However, when visualizing sale prices for 2017 only (right map), the neighborhood of Yorkville is now a different, distinct cluster. This is likely due to the arrival of the Q train in early 2017, which lead to a massive boom in real-estate for Yorkville. Our tool reclassified this area as its own Newerhood, adapting to localized changes and improving our contextual and temporal understanding of neighborhoods.

Another potential use case of NewerHoods involves comparing clusters to existing administrative boundaries. Specifically, we looked at violation rates, which are the least serious offenses (i.e., trespassing, disorderly conduct, jaywalking, etc.) and compared clusters to police precincts. We found that NewerHood clusters often reflect precinct boundaries (thick white borders) as depicted in the below figure. This suggests that individual precinct behavior may influence violations - is the likelihood of being ticketed for jaywalking dependent on which side of a precinct boundary you are on?
